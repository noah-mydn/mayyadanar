# Portfolio Website

A complete responsive portfolio website that is supposed to showcase the projects that I've worked on throughout my journey as a FullStack Web Developer. This portfolio does not currently have any projects, but those will be added as I work on various projects assigned by LearningPeople Global web development course. Through the portfolio, customers may view the performance of my previous work and contact me if my old works suit their needs via social media or a form featured on the web page. This fully responsive website is written in ReactJS using the Bootstrap library for styling. The website will respond appropriately to the width of the device regardless of its size.

### Features

* Feature-1

   > for screen sizes larger than 768px, the navigation bar will be fixed on top while there will be a hamburger menu available for smaller screen sizes where the    navigation menu could be viewed full page along with some social media icons at the end of the navigation menu items.

* Feature-2
 
   > the text and images are responsively designed in accordance with the screen size so that the font size and image size will be changed based on the device width.

* Feature-3

   > On the Contact page, the form is structured to fully function by using emailJS so that when the **SEND** button is clicked, the full name and email of the person inside the form field will be sent directly to the email setup in emailJS service as in the template designed by emailJS service user.
